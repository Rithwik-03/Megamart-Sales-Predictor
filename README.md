# Megamart-Sales-Predictor
    The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts sales for Big Mart outlets. This involves analyzing historical sales data, identifying key factors influencing sales, and building a robust model to predict future sales.

# Preprocessing:

 To prepare the data for model training, various preprocessing techniques are applied. This includes handling missing values by imputation, encoding categorical features using LabelEncoder, and performing exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.

# XGBoost Model Usage:

 The project utilizes XGBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm, as the core model for sales prediction. XGBoost is known for its accuracy and efficiency in handling structured data. The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset and evaluated using the R-squared metric to assess its predictive performance.
